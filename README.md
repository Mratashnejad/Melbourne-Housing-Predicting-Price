# Melbourne Housing Predicting Price 

## Introduction
Melbourne's real estate market is on the rise, and predicting the next big trend or finding a reasonably priced 2-bedroom unit can be challenging. That's where this project comes in! In this project, we analyze a dataset that includes various features such as Address, Type of Real estate, Suburb, Method of Selling, Rooms, Price, Real Estate Agent, Date of Sale, and distance from C.B.D. The dataset was created by Tony Pino, and it was scraped from publicly available results posted every week on Domain.com.au.

The dataset includes Address, Type of Real estate, Suburb, Method of Selling, Rooms, Price, Real Estate Agent, Date of Sale, distance from C.B.D., Regionname, Propertycount, Bedroom2, Bathroom, Car, Landsize, BuildingArea, and CouncilArea.

Which suburbs have the highest/lowest median house prices?
What is the most popular type of property sold in Melbourne?
What factors affect the price of a property the most?
Can we predict the price of a property based on its features?
## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project is an attempt to analyze the Melbourne housing dataset and predict the housing prices. With this analysis, we hope to gain insights into the Melbourne housing market and provide useful information for buyers, sellers, and real estate agents.
